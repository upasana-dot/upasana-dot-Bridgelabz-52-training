🚀 Bridgelabz Training – Java Learning Journey
🧠 Repository: Bridgelabz-2415500440-Training

This repository showcases my step-by-step learning progress in Java programming during the Bridgelabz Training Program.
Each branch highlights a different stage of my journey — from mastering core syntax to implementing Object-Oriented Design, Functional Programming, and Exception Handling.

🗂️ Repository Overview
🌿 Branch	📘 Focus Area
java-core	Java Fundamentals: syntax, data types, loops, arrays, strings, and logic building
java-oops	Object-Oriented Programming: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation
packages-in-java	Organizing code using packages and imports
wrapper-class	Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing
functional-interface	Functional Interfaces, Default/Static methods, and Lambda Expressions
error-and-exception	Exception Handling — built-in & custom exceptions
lambda-expression	Real-world examples using Lambda and functional-style programming

Focused on clean, reusable, and object-oriented code design



🗓️ Week 8 (Oct 13–15, 2025): Functional Interfaces & Lambdas

Completed learning Interfaces in Java

Studied Functional Interfaces, Default/Static Methods, and Marker Interfaces

Introduced to Lambda Expressions for concise coding

Practiced applying Lambdas with functional interfaces



🗓️ Week 9 (Oct 27–29, 2025): Packages, Exceptions & Wrapper Classes

Learned Java Packages — structure, usage, and imports

Studied Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, throw, throws

Understood checked vs unchecked exceptions

Created custom exceptions

Practiced Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing
